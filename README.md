# Memory Card Game
## The Odin Project's Exercise

This is a project from The Odin Project that is built using React.

The point of the game is to try and get the max score possible. In order to gain points, you must click on a photo which you haven't selected before. If you make the mistake  of selecting the same one twice, your score resets to zero.
